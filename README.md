## How to use
1) You need to download Magig Set Editor (MSE), available here: http://magicseteditor.boards.net/page/downloads

3) Place the downloaded contents inside the "/data" folder where you installed MSE.
4) Done! Now you can create new sets with these templates, selecting Exalted first, and then the template you want.

## Finding the cards already done
You can find all the charm cards already done in this drive:

## Tips for creating cards
1. Familiarize yourself with the icons and how to use them. In most cases, words such as "success", "dice" or "initiative" can be replaced with an icon. The full list of icons are here:

2. Don't use more than 7 lines of text. I noticed that using more makes the cards look bad and too crowded. The idea behind these cards is to be a helpful reminder of what the charm does, not grant it's full mechanics. Otherwise, charms like Wyld Shaping Technique would be imposible to get in a card. Normally, excluding ambientation (or flavor) text, examples and exceptions greatly reduce the space occupied by the text. Even then, there are some cases where it's still not enough and you will be forced to cut some words, rewrite lines, etc.

## Helping with the project
I'll do my best to do all the charms, but I realized that one of the things that consumes most of my time is finding good images for the cards. If you can find images for any of the charms without images (Or find a better image for an existing charm) i'd be really grateful.
Any images you find can be dropped via drive here:

Be sure to rename the image to the name of the charm you want it to go to.
Also, if you want to start doing charms for any other ability not completed yet or another exalt type, email me and we'll see how we distribute the work (federico.serron@gmail.com)
Also, if you have any enhancements to the code of the project, or cooler icons, email me or make a pull request so that I can merge your changes.
